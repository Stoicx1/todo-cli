## [Unreleased]

  - Fixed in both TaskEditPanel and NoteEditPanel
  - Cancel now works reliably without crashes

- **Notes Mode Display** - Fixed notes not appearing when switching from tasks mode
  - Root cause: Dual mode system desynchronization (`entity_mode` vs `left_panel_mode`)

  - Added logging to TaskEditPanel and NoteEditPanel button handlers
  - All panels now have 90-100% logging coverage with emoji-prefixed format
  - Example: `[NOTE_DETAIL] 🗑️ action_delete_note() called for note abc12345`

- **StatusBar Visibility** - Fixed critical rendering issue caused by incorrect height calculation
  - Resolved box-sizing: border-box height formula (7 debugging iterations)
  - Added comprehensive debug logging for StatusBar updates (37 log statements)

### Fixed
