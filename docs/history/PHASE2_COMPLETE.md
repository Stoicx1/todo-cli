# 🎉 PHASE 2 COMPLETE: Command System Integration

## Overview

Phase 2 adds full command-line functionality to the Textual UI, bridging the gap between keyboard shortcuts and the Rich CLI's powerful command system.

---

## ✅ New Features

### 1. Command Input Widget
- **Toggle**: Press `Ctrl+K` to show/hide command input
- **Autocomplete**: Start typing, see suggestions
- **History**: Up/Down arrows to navigate command history
- **Smart suggestions**: Context-aware completions

### 2. Full Command Integration
- All Rich CLI commands now work in Textual UI
- Commands execute via existing `core/commands.py` handlers
- Results shown as notifications
- State updates reflected immediately

### 3. Supported Commands

**Task Management**:
```bash
add "Task name" "comment" "description" priority "tag"
edit <id> "name" "comment" "description" priority "tag"
done <id>
undone <id>
remove <id>
show <id>
```

**Shortcuts**:
```bash
a    # add
e    # edit
x    # done
u    # undone
d    # delete (already works as keyboard shortcut)
s    # show
```

**Filtering** (Advanced):
```bash
filter status=done
filter priority=1
filter status=undone tag=psdc
filter priority>=2
filter tag=psdc,webasto           # OR logic
filter tag=psdc+webasto           # AND logic
f status=done                      # Shortcut
```

**Sorting**:
```bash
sort priority
sort priority desc
sort name asc
sort id
```

**Navigation**:
```bash
next       # Next page (or press 'n')
prev       # Previous page (or press 'p')
view compact
view detail
```

**AI & Help**:
```bash
insights   # Local AI insights
suggest    # Smart suggestions
?          # Ask GPT (requires API key)
help       # Show help
```

**System**:
```bash
clear      # Refresh screen
save       # Manual save
exit       # Save and quit (or press 'q')
```

## 🎮 How to Use

### Method 1: Keyboard Shortcuts (Quick)
- Press `x` to mark done
- Press `n` for next page
- Press `s` to sort
- Press `v` to toggle view

### Method 2: Command Mode (Powerful)
1. Press `Ctrl+K` to open command input
2. Type command (with autocomplete!)
3. Press `Enter` to execute
4. Command input hides automatically

### Method 3: Hybrid (Best of Both)
- Use shortcuts for quick actions
- Use commands for complex operations
- Example: `filter status=done tag=psdc priority>=2`

## 🔧 Command Input Features

### Autocomplete
As you type, suggestions appear:
```
f           → filter
filter s    → filter status=done
sort p      → sort priority
```

### Command History
- `Up Arrow`: Previous command
- `Down Arrow`: Next command
- History persists during session

### Smart Context
Command input knows common patterns:
```
filter      → suggests: status=done, priority=1, tag=
sort        → suggests: priority, id, name
view        → suggests: compact, detail
```

## 🎨 UI Updates

### New Footer
```
q Quit  ^k Command  a Add  x Done  u Undone  d Delete  f Filter  s Sort  n Next  p Prev  v View  r Refresh  ? Help
```

### Command Input (when visible)
```
╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ Type command (e.g., 'add', 'filter status=done', 'help') │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

## 🚀 Examples

### Example 1: Add Task via Command
```bash
Ctrl+K                                    # Open command mode
add "Fix bug" "urgent" "Login issue" 1 "work"  # Type command
Enter                                     # Execute
```

### Example 2: Advanced Filter
```bash
Ctrl+K
filter status=undone tag=psdc priority=1
Enter
```
Result: Shows incomplete, high-priority tasks tagged "psdc"

### Example 3: Show Task Details
```bash
Ctrl+K
show 5
Enter
```
Result: Displays full details for task #5

### Example 4: Bulk Operations
```bash

## 🔄 Comparison: Rich UI vs Textual UI

| Feature | Rich UI | Textual UI (Phase 2) |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| **Command Entry** | Prompt (always visible) | Toggle (Ctrl+K) |
| **Autocomplete** | Dropdown menu | Inline suggestions |
| **History** | File-based | Session-based |
| **Shortcuts** | Manual mapping | Native bindings |
| **Feedback** | Console output | Notifications |
| **State Updates** | Full redraw | Reactive updates |

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Panel Output**: Commands that return Rich panels (like `show <id>`) display simplified notifications. Use Rich UI for full panel view.

2. **GPT Streaming**: AI streaming (`?` command) works but shows in notification. Full streaming panel coming in Phase 4.

3. **Forms**: `add` and `edit` commands work with full syntax, but modal forms coming in Phase 3 will be easier.

---

## 📋 Next: Phase 3 (Modal Forms)

**Goals**:
- Interactive add/edit forms (no typing long commands!)
- Confirmation dialogs for delete
- Validation with inline error messages
- Tab navigation between fields

**Estimated Time**: 3 hours

**What you'll get**:
- Press `a` → Beautiful modal form appears
- Press `e` → Pre-filled edit form for selected task
- Press `d` on multiple tasks → Confirmation dialog
- Much easier than typing full commands!
