# AI Context Awareness Implementation

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Implemented and Tested

## Overview

Implemented context-aware AI chat that focuses on the currently edited task or note while maintaining access to full workspace for summaries and searches.

## Problem Solved

Previously, the AI had equal access to all tasks and notes at all times, with no awareness of what the user was currently working on. This made it difficult for the AI to provide focused assistance when editing a specific item.

## Solution Architecture

### Hybrid Approach (Prioritization + Context Injection)

**Key Principles:**
- AI can see all tasks/notes (for context and suggestions)
- AI prioritizes the current item being edited
- Clear visual **CURRENT FOCUS** section in context
- System prompt instructs AI to focus on current item
- New tool for quick focused context access

### Implementation Components

#### 1. Enhanced Context Building (`core/ai_agent.py`)

**File:** `core/ai_agent.py:213-338`

The `_build_context_string()` method now:
- Detects panel mode (LIST, DETAIL, EDIT for tasks and notes)
- Shows **CURRENT FOCUS** section when editing
- Shows **CURRENT VIEW** section when viewing details
- Includes full task/note details in focus section
- Provides workspace summary with available tags
- Limits description/body to 200-300 chars in context

**Example Context (Edit Mode):**
```
**CURRENT FOCUS** (You are editing this task):
- Task #42: "Fix login bug"
- Priority: HIGH (1)
- Tags: backend, bug
- Status: UNDONE
- Comment: Urgent - production issue
- Description: Users cannot log in with OAuth2
- Created: 2 days ago

Workspace Summary:
- Total tasks: 24 (8 done, 16 undone)
- Total notes: 5
- Available tags: api, backend, bug, design, feature, meeting, urgent
- Active filter: status=undone
- Current view: compact
```

#### 2. System Prompt Enhancement (`core/ai_agent.py`)

**File:** `core/ai_agent.py:442-461`

Added **CONTEXT AWARENESS (CRITICAL)** section to system prompt:
- Instructions on how to handle CURRENT FOCUS
- Rules for interpreting "this task", "this note", "it"
- Guidelines for suggesting improvements
- Examples of focused vs workspace-wide queries

#### 3. New Tool: `get_current_edit_context()` (`core/ai_tools.py`)

**File:** `core/ai_tools.py:738-867`

New LangChain tool that:
- Returns full details of currently edited/viewed item
- Works for both tasks and notes
- Detects EDIT vs DETAIL vs CREATE modes
- Shows timestamps (created, updated)
- Returns helpful message when in list mode
- Total tools: 22 (was 21)

**Tool Usage:**
```python
# When user is editing Task #42:
get_current_edit_context()
# Returns: Full markdown-formatted details of Task #42

# When user is in list view:
get_current_edit_context()
# Returns: "No task or note is currently being edited..."
```

#### 4. Comprehensive Test Coverage

**File:** `tests/test_ai_context_awareness.py`

18 tests covering:
- Context string building in all modes (6 tests)
- `get_current_edit_context()` tool behavior (6 tests)
- System prompt content (2 tests)
- Tool registry (2 tests)
- End-to-end integration (2 tests)

**Test Results:** ✅ 18/18 passing

## Benefits

### 1. Focused AI Assistance
- AI understands what you're working on
- Suggestions relevant to current task/note
- Natural language: "suggest better tags" applies to current item

### 2. Tag Consistency
- AI sees available workspace tags
- Suggests existing tags to avoid duplicates
- Maintains tag hygiene across workspace

### 3. Priority Context
- AI knows existing priority distribution
- Can suggest appropriate priorities
- Understands urgency in context

### 4. Workspace Awareness
- AI can still answer workspace-wide queries
- "show all high priority tasks" still works
- Summary statistics remain accessible

### 5. Non-Breaking Changes
- All existing functionality preserved
- Backward compatible
- No configuration required

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Editing a Task

**User Action:** Press `e` on Task #15 "Fix login bug"

**AI Context Receives:**
```
**CURRENT FOCUS** (You are editing this task):
- Task #15: "Fix login bug"
- Priority: HIGH (1)
- Tags: backend, bug
- Status: UNDONE
- Comment: Users report 401 errors
- Description: OAuth2 authentication fails intermittently
...
```

**User Prompt:** "suggest better tags"

**AI Response:** Analyzes Task #15 and suggests tags like "auth", "security", "backend" based on the task name and description, preferring tags that already exist in the workspace.

### Example 2: Viewing Task List

**User Action:** In task table list view

**AI Context Receives:**
```
Workspace Summary:
- Total tasks: 24 (8 done, 16 undone)
- Total notes: 5
- Available tags: api, backend, bug, feature, ...
- Active filter: status=undone
```

**User Prompt:** "create a task for code review"

**AI Response:** Creates a new task, suggests tags like "review" if it exists in workspace, sets appropriate priority.

### Example 3: Editing a Note

**User Action:** Edit note "Meeting Notes"

**AI Context Receives:**
```
**CURRENT FOCUS** (You are editing this note):
- Note abc12345: "Meeting Notes"
- Tags: meeting, design
- Linked to tasks: #5, #12
- Body excerpt: # Meeting with team\n\nDiscussed...
...
```

**User Prompt:** "summarize this"

**AI Response:** Uses `get_current_edit_context()` tool to get full note body and provides a concise summary.

## Technical Details

### Panel Mode Detection

Uses `state.left_panel_mode` (from `core.state.LeftPanelMode` enum):
- `LIST_TASKS` - Task table view (no focus)
- `DETAIL_TASK` - Viewing task detail (focus with "VIEWING")
- `EDIT_TASK` - Editing task (focus with "EDITING")
- `LIST_NOTES` - Notes table view (no focus)
- `DETAIL_NOTE` - Viewing note detail (focus with "VIEWING")
- `EDIT_NOTE` - Editing note (focus with "EDITING")

### State Tracking

- `state.selected_task_id: int | None` - Currently selected/editing task
- `state.selected_note_id: str | None` - Currently selected/editing note
- `state.edit_mode_is_new: bool` - Creating vs editing

### LangChain Integration

The enhanced context is injected into every AI query:
1. `TaskAssistantAgent._build_context_string()` builds focused context
2. Context prepended to user's question in prompt
3. LangChain ReAct agent receives full context
4. Agent can use `get_current_edit_context()` tool for more details
5. System prompt guides agent behavior

## Best Practices

### From Official Documentation (Oct 2025)

Based on LangChain and OpenAI best practices:

1. **Context Engineering** - "Filling context window with just the right information at each step" (LangChain)
2. **Local Context Matters** - "Recent steps matter far more than distant history" (OpenAI)
3. **Dynamic System Prompts** - Use runtime context injection (LangChain)
4. **Context Trimming** - Keep only relevant information (OpenAI)

### Implementation Alignment

✅ **Context Engineering** - Selects relevant info based on panel mode
✅ **Local Context** - Prioritizes currently edited item
✅ **Dynamic Prompts** - Context changes with panel mode
✅ **Context Trimming** - Limits description/body excerpts

## Manual Testing Guide

### Test Scenario 1: Task Editing Focus

1. Start the app: `python main.py`
2. Create a test task: `:add Test task prio 1 tag:backend`
3. Press `e` to edit the task
4. In AI chat, type: "suggest better tags for this"
5. **Expected:** AI suggests tags relevant to "Test task" and mentions "backend"

### Test Scenario 2: Workspace-Wide Query

1. Stay in task list view
2. In AI chat, type: "show all high priority tasks"
3. **Expected:** AI uses `search_tasks(filter_expression="priority=1")` and lists all high priority tasks

### Test Scenario 3: Note Context

1. Switch to notes mode: `mode notes`
2. Create a note: `note new --title "Design decisions"`
3. Edit the note (press `e`)
4. In AI chat, type: "is this note clear?"
5. **Expected:** AI uses `get_current_edit_context()` to read full note and provides feedback

### Test Scenario 4: Tag Consistency

1. View task list (should have some tasks with tags)
2. In AI chat, type: "what tags are available in my workspace?"
3. **Expected:** AI lists tags from workspace summary
4. Edit a task
5. In AI chat, type: "add more relevant tags"
6. **Expected:** AI suggests tags from the available tags list

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: AI doesn't focus on current task

**Symptom:** AI responds to "suggest tags" with generic suggestions

**Check:**
1. Verify you're in EDIT mode (not DETAIL or LIST)
2. Check `state.selected_task_id` is set
3. Check `state.left_panel_mode == LeftPanelMode.EDIT_TASK`

**Debug:**
```python
# In textual_app.py, add logging:
from debug_logger import debug_log
debug_log.info(f"Panel mode: {self.state.left_panel_mode}")
debug_log.info(f"Selected task: {self.state.selected_task_id}")
```

### Issue: "CURRENT FOCUS" not appearing in context

**Check:**
1. Ensure `core/ai_agent.py` imports `LeftPanelMode`
2. Verify `state.left_panel_mode` is set correctly
3. Check panel mode transitions in `textual_widgets/panels/left_panel_container.py`

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements (not yet implemented):

1. **Context Compression** - For very long descriptions/notes, use AI to summarize instead of truncating
2. **Related Items** - Include linked notes or related tasks in context
3. **Historical Context** - Show recent edits or changes to current item
4. **Smart Tag Suggestions** - ML-based tag suggestions based on task name/description
5. **Context Window Monitoring** - Track and optimize token usage
