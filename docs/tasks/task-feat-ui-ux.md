# Task: feat/ui-ux Branch - UI/UX Enhancements

**Branch:** `feat/ui-ux`
**Created:** 2025-10-28
**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** High

## Overview

Major UI/UX improvements for the Textual interface, focusing on:
1. Panel-based editing system (replacing modals)
2. AI chat status indicators
3. Theme switching and CSS stability fixes
4. Enhanced user experience during AI interactions

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Panel System Migration ✅
- Implemented `LeftPanelContainer` for dynamic panel switching
- Created panel modes: LIST_TASKS, DETAIL_TASK, EDIT_TASK, LIST_NOTES, DETAIL_NOTE, EDIT_NOTE
- Migrated from modal-based editing to in-place panel editing
- Vim-style editing experience in task/note areas

**Files Modified:**
- `textual_widgets/panels/left_panel_container.py` (new)
- `textual_widgets/panels/task_detail_panel.py`
- `textual_widgets/panels/task_edit_panel.py`
- `textual_widgets/panels/note_detail_panel.py`
- `textual_widgets/panels/note_edit_panel.py`
- `core/state.py` - Added `LeftPanelMode` enum

### Phase 2A: AI Chat Status Indicators ✅
**Commit:** `9240290` - feat(ai-chat): add status indicators during AI response delays

Eliminated 2-5 second "blank screen" during AI thinking/tool execution.

**Implementation:**
- Extended `AIMessage` model with `is_status: bool` field
- Added status methods to `AIChatPanel`:
  - `add_status_message(text)` - Create temporary status bubble
  - `remove_status_messages()` - Clean up all status messages
  - `update_status_message(text)` - Replace current status
- Updated `MessageBubble` to style status messages (dim, italic, no timestamp)
- Integrated 3-stage status progression into `stream_ai_response()`:
  1. "🤔 Thinking..." (worker start)
  2. "🧠 Loading AI agent..." (assistant init)
  3. "⚡ Processing request..." (before agent call)
- Status messages auto-remove on first chunk or error

**Files Modified:**
- `models/ai_message.py` (+8 lines)
- `textual_widgets/ai_chat_panel.py` (+88 lines)
- `textual_app.py` (+28 lines)

**User Benefit:**
- No more "blank screen" confusion
- Progressive feedback during AI processing
- Smooth visual transition to streaming

### Phase 2B: LangChain Save Tool ✅
**Commit:** `feat: add save_all_changes LangChain tool`

Added explicit save tool for AI agent with file name display.

**Implementation:**
- Created `save_all_changes()` tool in `core/ai_tools.py`
- Shows file name, task count, and note count
- Tool registry now has 21 total tools

**User Benefit:**
- AI can explicitly save when user asks
- Clear confirmation of what was saved

### Theme CSS Switching & Fixes ✅
**Status:** Completed

Fixed CSS parsing issues and implemented theme switching system.

**Problem:**
- CSS parsing errors causing app crashes
- Need for theme switching capability (dark/light modes)
- Textual CSS caching issues (per CLAUDE.md guidelines)

**Implementation:**
- Created `styles/theme-dark.tcss` - Dark theme variant
- Created `styles/theme-light.tcss` - Light theme variant
- Created `styles/theme-default-safe.tcss` - Safe fallback theme
- Backup of broken CSS: `styles/app_broken_backup.tcss`
- Following CLAUDE.md pattern: inline CSS only, no external CSS_PATH
- Refactored to config-based theme system (no runtime switching)

**Files:**
- `core/theme_config.py` (new module)
- `~/.todo_cli_theme.json` (user config file)
- Deleted: `styles/theme-dark.tcss`, `styles/theme-light.tcss`, etc. (moved to inline CSS)

**User Benefit:**
- Multiple theme options (dark/light)
- Stable CSS without parsing errors
- Better visual customization
- Predictable theme behavior (restart-based)

### Phase 3: Critical UI/UX Bug Fixes ✅
**Completed:** 2025-10-29

Resolved multiple critical UI/UX issues reported by user.

#### StatusBar Visibility Fix (Critical - 7 iterations)
**Problem:** StatusBar completely invisible despite generating content
**Root Cause:** Incorrect height calculation for `box-sizing: border-box` model

**Solution:**
- Fixed height formula: `total_height - borders - padding = content_space`
- Changed height from 6 to 4 with padding: 0 2
- Calculation: 4 rows - 2 border rows = 2 rows for 2-line content ✓
- Added 37 comprehensive debug log statements
- Removed `[dim]` markup tags causing dark text
- Moved out of collapsing `#bottom_section` container

**Files Modified:**
- `textual_widgets/status_bar.py` (added debug logging)
- `textual_app.py` (CSS changes for both themes)

#### Detail Panel Button Fix
**Problem:** Edit, Back, Delete buttons not working in detail panels
**Root Cause:** Missing `@work(exclusive=True)` decorator on async delete methods

**Solution:**
- Added decorator and import to both TaskDetailPanel and NoteDetailPanel

**Files Modified:**
- `textual_widgets/panels/task_detail_panel.py`
- `textual_widgets/panels/note_detail_panel.py`

#### Detail Panel Spacing Reduction
**Problem:** Excessive vertical spacing (~12-15 wasted rows) requiring too much scrolling

**Solution:**
- Systematically removed all unnecessary padding
- Field labels: 1 row → 0 rows
- Field values: 1 row → 0 rows
- Dividers: 2 rows → 0 rows
- Markdown: 4 rows (padding+margin) → 1 row (padding only)
- Removed empty Static spacer elements

**Files Modified:**
- `textual_widgets/panels/task_detail_panel.py` (CSS changes)
- `textual_widgets/panels/note_detail_panel.py` (CSS changes)

#### Layout Order Fix
**Problem:** Wrong stacking order (status → footer → AI input)

**Solution:**
- Added `dock: bottom` to ContextFooter
- Reordered yield statements (Textual stacks bottom-docked widgets in reverse)
- Result: StatusBar → AIInput → Footer ✓

**Files Modified:**
- `textual_widgets/context_footer.py`
- `textual_app.py` (layout reordering)

#### Input Switching UX Improvements
**Problem:** Confusing input switching, identical visual appearance, no unified toggle

**Solution:**
- Distinct border colors (CommandInput: yellow #c9a959, AIInput: cyan #06b6d4)
- Emoji prefixes (⚡ CMD, 🤖 AI)
- Smart toggle keybinding (Ctrl+/) - context-aware
- Updated footer hints

**Files Modified:**
- `textual_app.py` (CSS, keybindings, smart toggle action)
- `textual_widgets/command_input.py` (placeholder)
- `textual_widgets/ai_input.py` (placeholder)
- `textual_widgets/context_footer.py` (footer hints)

**Cleanup:**
- Removed 8 temporary debug files used during investigation

**User Benefit:**
- StatusBar now visible with proper contrast
- Detail panel buttons fully functional
- Compact detail panels (~50% less scrolling)
- Clear visual distinction between input types
- Unified input toggle for better UX

### Phase 3B: Critical Event Handling Fixes ✅
**Completed:** 2025-10-30

Fixed critical event bubbling and mode synchronization issues.

#### Escape Key Bubbling Fix (Critical)
**Problem:** Esc keypress triggered action in current panel AND bubbled to next panel
**Root Cause:** No event consumption after mode switch
**Impact:** Double execution (e.g., Esc in edit panel → back to list → Esc in list → close app)

**Solution:**
- Added `on_key()` handlers to all 4 panels
- Intercept Esc, execute action, consume event with `event.stop()` + `event.prevent_default()`
- Defensive try/except for robustness

#### Dual Mode Property Synchronization (Critical)
**Problem:** Mode switches updated `state.left_panel_mode` but not `app.left_panel_mode`
**Root Cause:** App reactive property triggers watcher that mounts panels
**Impact:** Mode change succeeded but panel didn't re-render (ghost state)

**Solution:**
- All mode switches now update BOTH properties:
  - `self.app.state.left_panel_mode = <mode>` (state tracking)
  - `self.app.left_panel_mode = <mode>` (triggers watcher)
- Wrapped in try/except for edge cases

#### Cancel Navigation Enhancement
**Improvement:** Cancel now returns to DETAIL (not LIST) when editing existing items
**UX Benefit:** User stays on selected item context after canceling edit

**Files Modified:**
- `textual_widgets/panels/task_detail_panel.py` (+30 lines)
- `textual_widgets/panels/task_edit_panel.py` (+50 lines)
- `textual_widgets/panels/note_detail_panel.py` (+30 lines)
- `textual_widgets/panels/note_edit_panel.py` (+49 lines)

**User Benefit:**
- No more double Esc execution
- Reliable panel switching
- Predictable navigation flow

## Planned Work (Future Enhancements)

### Phase 4: Tool Execution Indicators
Show real-time tool usage during AI operations.

**Plan:**
- Parse LangChain agent logs during execution
- Show "🔧 Using tool: add_task" status messages
- Update status dynamically during tool execution
- Handle multi-tool scenarios

**Estimated Time:** 45 minutes

**Files to Modify:**
- `textual_app.py` - Enhanced streaming callback
- `core/ai_agent.py` - Tool event callbacks

### Phase 2C: Polish & Animations
**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes

- CSS fade transitions for status messages
- Pulsing dot animation for "Thinking..."
- Visual polish for smooth UX

**Files to Modify:**
- `textual_app.py` - CSS additions
- `textual_widgets/ai_chat_panel.py` - Animation classes

### Phase 3: Additional UX Enhancements (TBD)
- Keyboard shortcut improvements
- Better focus management
- Enhanced error messages

## Related Issues

- Fixes blank screen during AI thinking (reported by user)
- Improves panel-based editing UX
- Enhances AI transparency and feedback
- Fixes CSS parsing errors causing app crashes
- Adds theme customization for better user experience

## Notes

- Status messages are ephemeral (`is_status=True`) and don't persist to history
- All UI updates from worker thread use `call_from_thread()` for thread safety
- Panel system eliminates modal-related issues on certain terminals
- Follow CLAUDE.md patterns for Textual reserved attributes
- **CSS Pattern:** Use inline CSS in `textual_app.py` only, avoid external `.tcss` files (per CLAUDE.md)
- Theme files stored in `styles/` for reference/backup but loaded inline
- Theme preference should persist in `~/.todo_cli_settings.json`

## Merge Strategy

1. Complete Theme CSS Integration
2. Complete Phase 2B (Tool Execution Indicators) and 2C (Polish & Animations)
3. Run full test suite (including theme tests)
4. Manual testing session (all features + theme switching)
5. Update documentation (USAGE_GUIDE.md, CHANGELOG.md)
6. Create PR to main branch
7. Squash commits if needed (or keep detailed history)
